This project serves the purpose of implementing UART communication protocols using FPGA.
The use of an Arduino device along with the serial monitor allows for the data to be sent to the FPGA utilizing the ASCI code.
The data is then captured using UART which adds one value to the ASCI code and sends it back to Arduino.
